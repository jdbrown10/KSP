{OPERATORS}

{+, -, <, >, =, *, / are all self explanatory}

{mod is the modular operator -> performs division and return the remainder}
{10 mod 3 = 1}

{assignment operator is ":="}

{bit operators are also a thing-- very rarely used}

{# is the "is not" operator}

{can't compare string variables -> "string" = "string" is not allowed}
